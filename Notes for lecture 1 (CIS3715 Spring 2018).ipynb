    "# About Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is data science**. Data science refers to obtaining, processing, getting insights about potentially large quantities or messy data, and communicating those insights to others. To be successful in data science takes a wide range of technical skills, including programming, algorithmic thinking, statistical thinking, and math. Good data scienctists also have a range of soft skills, including perseverance, curiosity, and ability to work in teams with diverse expertise. The last, but not least, having talent for design and communication with non-experts can be a great plus. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Some examples**. To get an idea about data science, take a look at some success stories. Here are some successful uses of data science in **Internet**:\n",
    "- Internet search (autocomplete feature, ranking of results, see Google search)\n",
    "- Targeted advertising (deciding which ads to show, how to show them, and how to price them, see any .com web page)\n",
    "- Recommender systems (deciding which items to recommend, see Amazon, Netflix, Google News, Facebook Timeline)\n",
    "- Spam detection (Gmail success story)\n",
    "- Digital journalism and storytelilng (visualizations of data supporting the stories, see New York Times)\n",
    " - http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/05/17/business/dealbook/how-the-facebook-offering-compares.html?_r=0\n",

    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some success stories in **traditional businesses and government**:\n",
    "- Business intelligence (understanding the cometitive landscape and oportunities and risks, sales analysis, see any business)\n",

    "\n",
    "Here are some success stories in a subfield of data science called the **machine learning**:\n",
    "- Self-driving cars (the holy grail of transportation industry, see Google car, Uber)\n",
    "- Robotics (making machines that can make autonomous decisions, see Mars Exploration Rover, BostonDynamics dogs)\n",
    "- Speech understanding and synthesis (try Amazon Echo, Apple Siri)\n",
    "- Language translation (try Google Translate)\n",
    "- Computer vision (understanding images, see Google Translate)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why learn data science**. Data science is the job of 21st century. As we are creating more and more data as part of our daily lives, as scientists are developing better techniques to collect data, and businesses and governments are starting to understand the potential of big data, there is an increased need for people able to handle, visualize, analyze, and obtain insights from data. This is already reflected in the job market, where *data scientist* jobs are starting to outnumber some traditional jobs for computer scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning about data science jobs**. To get an unbiased snapshot of data science jobs, recruiting sites such as Indeed.com are a great resource. Let us thake a look:\n",
    "- go to Indeed and type 'data science', 'data scientist', 'programmer', 'software developer', 'database administrator', 'software testing', 'web developer', 'lab technician'. Discuss the number of jobs and estimated salary ranges.\n",
    "- go to https://jessesw.com/Data-Science-Skills/ (see an analysis of data science adds using python)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What will we learn in CIS3717**. This course is aimed at providing a holistic view of data science and showing students the basic building blocks needed for doing data science. The path to expertise in data science is long (and often extends to Ph.D. studies), and this course aims to provide the first step. Since data science is all about *doing*, we will have to learn how to use some important tools:\n",
    "- Python programming language and its packages such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn\n",
    "- IPython notebook and Spyder IDEs\n",
    "- Tableau software and D3.js for data visualization \n",
    "- SQLite and MongoDB databases\n",
    "- AWS for cloud computing\n",
    "- Spark for handling big data\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the use of those tools, we will learn many techniques for data science:\n",
    "- web scrapping\n",
    "- preprocessing of unstructured, semi-structured, and messy data\n",
    "- visualizing data\n",
    "- building and validating predictive models\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop capability to use sophisticated techniques of data science and build customized solutions, this course will also cover the fundamentals:\n",
    "- exploratory data analysis\n",
    "- statistical thinking\n",

    "**Importance of Google search for data science**. Data science takes many hours and requires curiosity. Google search is a major tool for a data scientist. Internet search with Google allows you to find answer to most of your programming-related questions. For example, after typing query 'how to add color to ipython markup', the first link (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19746350/how-does-one-change-color-in-markdown-cells-ipython-jupyter-notebook) was the answer I was looking for I learned how to write: \n",
    "\n",
    "Hi, the following is text in <font color='green'>GREEN</font> and in <font color='red'>RED</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where is data coming from?** Data for data science could be obtained in multiple ways. For example, it might be provided by your client as a spreadsheet or a database. Sometimes, your client or yourself have a data science project in mind, but do not have the data ready. Luckily, there are many data sets in a decent format already available for playing:\n",
    "- Kaggle\n",
    "- UCI\n",
    "- google search (it is amazing how much data is lying around)\n",
    "\n",
    "Very often, the data exists on the web, but needs to be scraped and put in the right shape through some programming, before you can do any data analysis. Python is a great tool to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python as the programming language for data science**. There is a large community of programmers which developed much useful code and toolboxes for data science, many user-friendly tutorials, and a large number of answers to questions you might have. A successful data scientist has a skill to *stand on the shoulders of giants* and utilize all those resources to his or her advantage. Let us look at some examples:\n",
    "- If you are using some well-known data, you might be able to see how other people analyzed it. For example, try 'ipynb boston housing'\n",
    "- Type 'python scraping airbnb' and you will find things like this: \n",
    " - https://github.com/mrafa3/AirbnbScrape/blob/master/AirbnbWrapUp.ipynb (a function that scrapes Airbnb)\n",
    " - http://hamelsmu.github.io/AirbnbScrape/ (a data science course project)\n",
