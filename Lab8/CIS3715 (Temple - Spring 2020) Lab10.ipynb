It's a set of 60,000 training images, plus 10,000 test images, assembled by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (the NIST in MNIST) in the 1980s. You can think of \"solving\" MNIST as the \"Hello World\" of deep learning -- it's what you do to verify that your algorithms are working as expected. As you get deep in machine learning field, you will see MNIST come up over and over again, in scientific papers, blog posts, and so on.\n",
