We will write it matematically as $x_2 = [x_{21}, x_{22}, x_{23}, x_{24}] = [4.9, 3.0, 1.4, 0.2]$. We see that its `target` is 0, which means the type of this iris is `setosa`.

    "### Supervised Learning\n",
    "Supervised learning is a game with the following objective. You are given the iris data set $D_{Iris}$ where you know 4 attributes and target values for 150 irises and your objective is to come up with a computer program that predicts a type of any iris flower given the values of its 4 attributes. Written in pseudocode, this is what you have to do:\n",

    "`predictor = create(algorithm_type, D)\n",

    "In the first line, you are running a `create` function that takes as input data set `D` and the name of a supervised learning algorithm `algorithm_type` and produces as an output a computer program `predictor`. In the second line, you are using `predictor` to predict the label (`y_new` value) for a flower whose attributes are given by `x_new`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### kNN Algorithm\n",
    "kNN is a popular supervised learning algorithm that allows us to create `predictor`. The idea of kNN is that the label of flower `x_new` depends on labels of flowers in its neighborhood. In particular, kNN finds the distance between `x_new` and every example `x` in data set `D`. Then, it looks at the label `y` of k examples which are the closest to `x_new`. The predicted label `y_new` is obtained as the most common label in the group of the k nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameter choice**. We need to make a few decisions when running kNN. The most important is the choice of `k`. If `k = 1`, then we are looking only at the hearest neighbor and it might not be a good idea if we are dealing with noisy data. If `k` is very large, then we might be counting far neighbors that might have different properties. Other decisions include the choice of distance metric (Euclidean is the standard one) and the choice whether to weight closer neighbors more than the farther ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy**. When deciding which parameters to pick or which supervised learning algorithm to use (there are popular algorithms other than kNN), the question is how to measure which choice is better. The answer is to check if `predictor` provides accurate prediction. Given a data set `D`, a typical way to check accuracy is to randomly split `D` into two data sets, `D_train` and `D_test`. Then, `predictor` is created/trained using `D_train` data set and its accuracy is checked using `D_test`. In particular, we use `predictor` to predict label of every example from `D_test` and compare it with the true labels. The percentage of the correct guesses on `D_test` is reported as accuracy of `predictor`.\n",

Pay attention that the 12th column in the data set (quality) should be your label (call it y) and the first 11 columns should be your attribues (call it X). Because y are numbers from 0-10, let us create a binary label by converting ratings 7 and below to 0 and ratings above 7 as 1. Split your data into 66% training and 33% test data sets. Train a kNN classifier ($k=3$ and defaults) on the training data and test its accuracy on test data. Record the computational time needed to run this. Report the accuracy.\n",

In order to give each attribute equal change, scale each attribute to the same range to make sure the minimum is 0 and maximum is 1. *Question*: What is the formula to achieve this? Implement this formula and create a scaled data set (remember, any scaling you apply on the training data should also be used on the test data). Apply kNN and measure the accuracy.
